### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
TODO:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:

 _ Train Name

 _ Destination

 _ First Train Time -- in military time

 _ Frequency -- in minutes

- Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

- Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

- Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!

## Installation

TODO: Bootstrap; Javascript; Jquery; Firebase; Moment.js
